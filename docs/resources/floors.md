# catalystcenter_floors (Resource)

Manages multiple floors within a single resource, specifying a list of floors as input. This resource is designed for bulk operations to efficiently create multiple floors at once. To retrieve existing floors, use the data source `catalystcenter_sites` with type filter set to 'floor'

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "catalystcenter_floors" "example" {
  floors = [
    {
      parent_name_hierarchy = "Global/USA/Building1"
      name                  = "Floor1"
      floor_number          = 1
      rf_model              = "Drywall Office Only"
      width                 = 40
      length                = 50.5
      height                = 3.5
      units_of_measure      = "meters"
    }
  ]
}
```
