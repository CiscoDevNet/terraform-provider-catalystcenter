# catalystcenter_fabric_vlan_to_ssid (Resource)

Add, update, or remove SSID mappings to a VLAN. If the payload doesn't contain a 'vlanName' which has SSIDs mapping done earlier then all the mapped SSIDs of the 'vlanName' is cleared. The request must include all SSIDs currently mapped to a VLAN, as determined by the response from the GET operation for the same fabricId used in the request. If an already-mapped SSID is not included in the payload, its mapping will be removed by this API. Conversely, if a new SSID is provided, it will be added to the Mapping. Ensure that any new SSID added is a Fabric SSID. This API can also be used to add a VLAN and associate the relevant SSIDs with it. The 'vlanName' must be 'Fabric Wireless Enabled' and should be part of the Fabric Site representing 'Fabric ID' specified in the API request

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "catalystcenter_fabric_vlan_to_ssid" "example" {
  fabric_id = "5e8e3e3e-1b6b-4b6b-8b6b-1b6b4b6b8b6b"
  mappings = [
    {
      vlan_name = "VLAN_1"
      ssid_details = [
        {
          name               = "mySSID1"
          security_group_tag = "Auditors"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
