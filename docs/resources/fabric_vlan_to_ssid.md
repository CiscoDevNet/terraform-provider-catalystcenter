# catalystcenter_fabric_vlan_to_ssid (Resource)

Add, update, or remove SSID mappings to a VLAN. If the configuration does not contain a 'vlanName' which has SSIDs mapping done earlier then all the mapped SSIDs of the 'vlanName' are cleared. The request must include all SSIDs currently mapped to a VLAN, as determined by the response from the GET operation for the same fabricId used in the request. If an already-mapped SSID is not included in the confiugration, its mapping will be removed by this resource. Conversely, if a new SSID is provided, it will be added to the mapping. Ensure that any new SSID added is a Fabric SSID. This API can also be used to add a VLAN and associate the relevant SSIDs with it. The 'vlanName' must be 'Fabric Wireless Enabled' and should be part of the Fabric Site representing 'Fabric ID' specified in the configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "catalystcenter_fabric_vlan_to_ssid" "example" {
  fabric_id = "5e8e3e3e-1b6b-4b6b-8b6b-1b6b4b6b8b6b"
  mappings = [
    {
      vlan_name = "VLAN_1"
      ssid_details = [
        {
          name               = "mySSID1"
          security_group_tag = "Auditors"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
