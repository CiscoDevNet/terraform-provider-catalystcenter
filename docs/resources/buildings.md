# catalystcenter_buildings (Resource)

Manages multiple buildings within a single resource, specifying a list of buildings as input. This resource is designed for bulk operations to efficiently create multiple buildings at once. To retrieve existing buildings, use the data source `catalystcenter_sites` with type filter set to 'building'

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "catalystcenter_buildings" "example" {
  buildings = [
    {
      parent_name_hierarchy = "Global/USA"
      name                  = "Building1"
      country               = "United States"
      address               = "150 W Tasman Dr, San Jose"
      latitude              = 37.338
      longitude             = -121.832
    }
