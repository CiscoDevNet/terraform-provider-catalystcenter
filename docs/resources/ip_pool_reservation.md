# catalystcenter_ip_pool_reservation (Resource)

This resource manages an IP reserve subpool using the new API schema.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "catalystcenter_ip_pool_reservation" "example" {
  name                = "MyRes1"
  pool_type           = "Generic"
  site_id             = "5e6f7b3a-2b0b-4a7d-8b1c-0d4b1cd5e1b1"
  ipv4_subnet         = "192.168.10.0"
  ipv4_prefix_length  = 24
  ipv4_gateway        = "192.168.10.1"
  ipv4_dhcp_servers   = ["1.2.3.4"]
  ipv4_dns_servers    = ["2.3.4.5"]
  ipv4_global_pool_id = "1b2c3d4e-1111-2222-3333-abcdefabcdef"
  ipv6_subnet         = "2001:db8:8000::"
  ipv6_prefix_length  = 64
  ipv6_gateway        = "2001:db8:8000::1"

## Schema

### Required

- `ipv4_global_pool_id` (String) The non-tunnel global pool ID for this IPv4 reserve pool. Once added, this value cannot be changed.
- `ipv4_prefix_length` (Number) The IPv4 network mask length as a decimal for the CIDR notation of this subnet.
- `ipv4_subnet` (String) The IPv4 IP address component of the CIDR notation for this subnet.
- `name` (String) The name for this reserve IP pool. Only letters, numbers, '-' (hyphen), '_' (underscore), '.' (period), and '/' (forward slash) are allowed.
- `pool_type` (String) The type of the reserve IP subpool. Once created, this cannot be changed.
  - Choices: `Generic`, `LAN`, `Management`, `Service`, `WAN`
- `site_id` (String) The id of the non-Global site that this subpool belongs to.

### Optional

- `ipv4_assigned_addresses` (String) The number of addresses assigned from the IPv4 pool (numeric string).
- `ipv4_default_assigned_addresses` (String) The number of addresses that are assigned from the IPv4 pool by default (numeric string).
- `ipv4_dhcp_servers` (Set of String) The IPv4 DHCP server(s) for this subnet.
- `ipv4_dns_servers` (Set of String) The IPv4 DNS server(s) for this subnet.
- `ipv4_gateway` (String) The IPv4 gateway IP address for this subnet.
- `ipv4_total_addresses` (String) The total number of addresses in the IPv4 pool (numeric string).
- `ipv4_unassignable_addresses` (String) The number of addresses in the IPv4 pool that cannot be assigned (numeric string).
- `ipv6_assigned_addresses` (String) The number of addresses assigned from the IPv6 pool (numeric string).
- `ipv6_default_assigned_addresses` (String) The number of addresses that are assigned from the IPv6 pool by default (numeric string).
- `ipv6_dhcp_servers` (Set of String) The IPv6 DHCP server(s) for this subnet.
- `ipv6_dns_servers` (Set of String) The IPv6 DNS server(s) for this subnet.
- `ipv6_gateway` (String) The IPv6 gateway IP address for this subnet.
- `ipv6_global_pool_id` (String) The non-tunnel global pool ID for this IPv6 reserve pool. Once added, this value cannot be changed.
- `ipv6_prefix_length` (Number) The IPv6 network mask length as a decimal for the CIDR notation of this subnet.
- `ipv6_slaac_support` (Boolean) If the IPv6 prefixLength is 64, this option may be enabled for SLAAC.
- `ipv6_subnet` (String) The IPv6 IP address component of the CIDR notation for this subnet.
- `ipv6_total_addresses` (String) The total number of addresses in the IPv6 pool (numeric string, up to 128 bits).
- `ipv6_unassignable_addresses` (String) The number of addresses in the IPv6 pool that cannot be assigned (numeric string).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The id of the object

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
