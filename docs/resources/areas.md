# catalystcenter_areas (Resource)

Manages multiple areas within a single resource, specifying a map of areas as input. This resource is designed for bulk operations to efficiently create multiple areas at once. To retrieve existing areas, use the data source `catalystcenter_sites` with type filter set to 'area'

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "catalystcenter_areas" "example" {
  scope = "Global/Poland"
  areas = {
    "Global/Area1" = {
      parent_name_hierarchy = "Global"
      name                  = "Area1"
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `areas` (Attributes Map) Map of areas, keyed by parent_name_hierarchy/name (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--areas))

### Optional

- `scope` (String) Optional scope to limit which areas are managed by this resource. When specified, only areas under this hierarchy path will be included. The resource ID will use this scope value. Example: 'Global/Poland' to manage only Polish sites

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--areas"></a>
### Nested Schema for `areas`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the area
- `parent_name_hierarchy` (String) Parent hierarchical name (e.g., Global/USA)

Optional:

- `id` (String) The id of the area
- `parent_id` (String) The parent ID of the area

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import catalystcenter_areas.example "<id>"
```
