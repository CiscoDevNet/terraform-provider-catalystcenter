# catalystcenter_telemetry_settings (Resource)

This resource can manage a Telemetry Settings.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "catalystcenter_telemetry_settings" "example" {
  site_id                             = "5e6f7b3a-2b0b-4a7d-8b1c-0d4b1cd5e1b1"
  enable_wired_data_collection        = true
  enable_wireless_telemetry           = true
  use_builtin_trap_server             = true
  external_trap_servers               = ["10.0.0.1"]
  use_builtin_syslog_server           = true
  external_syslog_servers             = ["10.0.0.1"]
  netflow_collector                   = "Builtin"

## Schema

### Required

- `enable_netflow_collector_on_devices` (Boolean) Enable Netflow Application Telemetry and Controller Based Application Recognition (CBAR) by default upon network device site assignment for wired access devices
- `enable_wired_data_collection` (Boolean) Track the presence, location, and movement of wired endpoints in the network. Traffic received from endpoints is used to extract and store their identity information (MAC address and IP address). Other features, such as IEEE 802.1X, web authentication, Cisco Security Groups (formerly TrustSec), SD-Access, and Assurance, depend on this identity information to operate properly. Wired Endpoint Data Collection enables Device Tracking policies on devices assigned to the Access role in Inventory
- `enable_wireless_telemetry` (Boolean) Enables Streaming Telemetry on your wireless controllers in order to determine the health of your wireless controller, access points and wireless clients
- `netflow_collector` (String) Application Visibility Collector Type
  - Choices: `Builtin`, `TelemetryBrokerOrUDPDirector`
- `site_id` (String) The site ID
- `use_builtin_syslog_server` (Boolean) Enable this server as a destination server for syslog messages
- `use_builtin_trap_server` (Boolean) Enable this server as a destination server for SNMP traps and messages from your network

### Optional

- `external_syslog_servers` (Set of String) External syslog servers
- `external_trap_servers` (Set of String) External SNMP trap servers
- `netflow_collector_ip_address` (String) IP Address. If collection type is `TelemetryBrokerOrUDPDirector`, this field value is mandatory otherwise it is optional
- `netflow_collector_port` (Number) If collection type is `TelemetryBrokerOrUDPDirector`, this field value is mandatory otherwise it is optional
  - Range: `1`-`65535`

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The id of the object

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import catalystcenter_telemetry_settings.example "<site_id>"
```
