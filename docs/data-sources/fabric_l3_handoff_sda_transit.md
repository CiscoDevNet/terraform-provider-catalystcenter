## Schema

### Required

- `fabric_id` (String) ID of the fabric this device is assigned to
- `network_device_id` (String) Network device ID of the fabric device

### Read-Only

- `affinity_id_decider` (Number) Affinity id decider value of the border node. When the affinity id prime value is the same on multiple devices, the affinity id decider value is used as a tiebreaker.
- `affinity_id_prime` (Number) Affinity id prime value of the border node. It supersedes the border priority to determine border node preference.
- `connected_to_internet` (Boolean) Set this true to allow associated site to provide internet access to other sites through sd-access.
- `id` (String) The id of the object
- `is_multicast_over_transit_enabled` (Boolean) Set this true to configure native multicast over multiple sites that are connected to an sd-access transit.
