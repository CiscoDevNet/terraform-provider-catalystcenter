## Schema

### Required

- `site_id` (String) The site ID

### Read-Only

- `enable_netflow_collector_on_devices` (Boolean) Enable Netflow Application Telemetry and Controller Based Application Recognition (CBAR) by default upon network device site assignment for wired access devices
- `enable_wired_data_collection` (Boolean) Track the presence, location, and movement of wired endpoints in the network. Traffic received from endpoints is used to extract and store their identity information (MAC address and IP address). Other features, such as IEEE 802.1X, web authentication, Cisco Security Groups (formerly TrustSec), SD-Access, and Assurance, depend on this identity information to operate properly. Wired Endpoint Data Collection enables Device Tracking policies on devices assigned to the Access role in Inventory
- `enable_wireless_telemetry` (Boolean) Enables Streaming Telemetry on your wireless controllers in order to determine the health of your wireless controller, access points and wireless clients
- `external_syslog_servers` (Set of String) External syslog servers
- `external_trap_servers` (Set of String) External SNMP trap servers
- `id` (String) The id of the object
- `netflow_collector` (String) Application Visibility Collector Type
- `netflow_collector_ip_address` (String) IP Address. If collection type is `TelemetryBrokerOrUDPDirector`, this field value is mandatory otherwise it is optional
- `netflow_collector_port` (Number) If collection type is `TelemetryBrokerOrUDPDirector`, this field value is mandatory otherwise it is optional
- `use_builtin_syslog_server` (Boolean) Enable this server as a destination server for syslog messages
- `use_builtin_trap_server` (Boolean) Enable this server as a destination server for SNMP traps and messages from your network
